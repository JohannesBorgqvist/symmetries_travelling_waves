Ok, so we are interested in the following PDE
$$\xi_{uu}+\dfrac{\ell}{u}\xi_u=0.$$
This one we solve by hand which gives us the following equation
\begin{equation}
\xi{(z,u)}=A(z)\left(\dfrac{1}{1-\ell}\right)u^{1-\ell}-B(z)
\label{eq:xi}
\end{equation}
where $A,B\in\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$.
