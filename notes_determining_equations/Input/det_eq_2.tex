Ok, so we are interested in solving the following PDE
$$2c\xi_u u^{\ell}+\eta_{uu}-2\xi_{zu}-\dfrac{(\eta_u-2\xi_z)\ell}{u}+\dfrac{\ell\eta}{u^2}=0$$
for the unknown tangent $\eta(z,u)$. We plugged this PDE into Wolphram Alpha, and out came the following suggested solution

\begin{equation}
\eta{(z,u)}=2cA(z)\left(\dfrac{1}{\ell-2}\right)u^2+A'(z)\left(\dfrac{2\ell-1}{(\ell-1)^2}\right)u^{2-\ell}+2B'(z)\left(\dfrac{\ell}{\ell-1}\right)u\ln(u)+C(z)u^{\ell}+D(z)u
\label{eq:eta}
\end{equation}
where $C,D\in\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ are two new arbitrary functions.
