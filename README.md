# Model construction of travelling wave models of collective cell migration in two spatial dimensions using Lie symmetries
*Date:* 2023-01-03,<br>
*Written by:* Johannes Borgqvist.<br>
We illustrate the symmetries of travelling wave models of collective cell migration in two spatial dimensions. This repositry is an open--source repositry written in Python which contains two scripts:

1. "*plot\_travelling\_wave\_symmetries.py*",
2. "*cell\_migration\_FEM\_simulation.py*".

The first script plots the symmetries of three candidate models referred to as the exponential, logistic and generalised model. The second script simulates collective cell migration in two spatial dimensions by solving a PDE that was constructed based on Lie symmetries.
